This is a test application build in Haskell with stack, nix, scotty in order to help me improve my Haskell Skills.

Basically i want to write a REST app which proxy Twitter's User Timeline consumption.

I am going to evolve the app to achieve the following results:

- Learn more Haskell
- Learn Scotty
- Learn [Service Pattern](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/meiersi/the-service-pattern)
- Learn integration with build tools Stack and Nix
